I employ a variety of methods (e.g. surveys, lab experiments etc.) to investigate the cognitive, biological and economic foundations of socio-political attitudes and beliefs. Here are some of my interests

## Political ideology and intergroup relations

This area of study seeks to understand how political beliefs and values influence interactions between different social, ethnic, and political groups, as well as the consequences of these interactions for social cohesion and conflict. 

## Threat perception, risk-taking and negativity bias
This area seeks to understand how threat perception, risk-taking and negativity bias shape human behavior, with a particular focus on the broad applications for understanding intergroup relations, anti-democratic behaviors, and political beliefs. 

## The antecedents and consequences of conspiracy beliefs

This area of study seeks to understand the factors that lead individuals to adopt conspiracy theories and the impacts these beliefs have on behavior and society.
