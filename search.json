    "text": "I am interested in how stress, danger, and negativity biases influence cognitive, emotional and decision-making processes of individuals and groups when facing various large-scale threats (e.g., such as terrorism, financial crises, climate change, pandemics, crime, and police threats). Specifically, I focus on understanding why individuals with different ideological belief systems, including those on the left and right of the spectrum, either “close off” by favoring exclusionary, security-focused, and risk-averse measures or “reach out” by prioritizing liberty-focused, collaborative, and inclusionary responses to threats.\nDivergent responses to threats not only deepen interpersonal and intergroup polarization and conflict but also decrease willingness to compromise, potentially promoting anti-democratic behaviors. My research also explores how perception of shared threats and challenges can foster cooperation and reduce polarization when individuals and groups unite around common goals and engage in inclusive dialogue to enhance cooperation.\nBy uncovering how political beliefs shape perceptions of threats and subsequent responses, my research aims to inform strategies that promote understanding, dialogue, and resilience in democratic societies facing complex challenges."
